# workshop

This holds the PHP-based web UI for workshop.solsector.net and the routines required to export all the available campaign data as XML.
Of course, this also holds the code to persist data. I haven't decided yet, whether this will be done by using MySQL, plain-text or whatever.

The XML files can then be used with UnnamedCharacter's WC1 library to encode them into binary data files that can be used with the original game engine.
